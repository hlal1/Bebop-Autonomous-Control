# Bebop-Autonomous-Control
ROS code for the control of Parrot Bebop incorporated in the project on package delivery system to homes.

Please read the abstract in the attached Package Delivery System pdf to get an idea of the project.

my_drone ROS package contains the necessary code for the autonomous impementation of the drone. Need to install ROS driver for the drone, bebop_autonomy before using the my_drone package.
